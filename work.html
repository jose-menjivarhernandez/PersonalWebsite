                Stock Return Predictions through Multi-Factor Modelling, <br>
                and comparison with GRU ML results.
            </h3>
            <p>
                For SENG 550 - Large Scale Data Systems Engineering, my teammates and I <br>
                built a python-based application that had the ability to pull historical <br>
                pricing any random subset of stocks in the S&P 500 index. We then used this<br>
                data to run a linear regression ML algorithm. The features used were the financial <br>
                "factors", which according to financial theory, can explain stock returns. <br>
                The labels were price returns on the individual stocks. We then used a <br>
                gated recurring unit Neural Net only with previous historical prices <br>
                as features for future stock predictions and compared the results.<br>

            <p>
                For CPSC 471 - Database Development, my teammates and I decided we <br>
                we wanted to build a social media application that instead of reinforcing <br>
                bad habits of distraction, promoted healthy habit building and community. <br>
                The application has certain functionality such that people can create groups <br>
                where everyone practices a habit and posts about their progress on an ongoing basis.
